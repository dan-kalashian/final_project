This is the README for my Final Project #1

The Final1_Program.py combines words from various txt files to create a "Scrapbook" that tells a small story. 
Program then allows user to input how they want the story to end. They do this by choosing which file they want to use to complete their story. 
From there, grammatical elements of certain parts of the sentence are explained. 
After that, the story continues to include the charachter looking up what grocery stores are online then sharing his findings
After that, for users still interested in grammar, Enlgish classes available at UMD are shown

Other files in this repo include the txt files that are used to make the work scrapbook. 
Thank you for reading, and I hope you enjoy :)
